▶︎//Project Specs
	'Find A Companion' 
	Find a Companion is a online search engine for adoptable animals. Users can easily input what species they are looking for and get a list of animals matching that search criteria. Photos of the animals, a description of the animals' behavior and specifications, and contact info for the organization that has the animal.

▶︎//Design Notes 
	Documentation: 
		User runs code and receives website url; once at the website,  the user can input an animal species in the search bar on the home page and hit the search button. The search button will take them to a new page containing pictures only of the species they searched for. Underneath each image will be a short blurb about the animal; name, general age range, and sex, and a ‘+’ button to take the user to a more comprehensive description page. Description of each animal is provided by Petfinder. In addition to the home page, there will also be an ‘Adoptions’ page containing a sample page of available cats. 

	Installation Instructions: 
		Must have flask, flask_bootstrap, and flask_nav installed. Once installed, run code and receive a url that must be pasted into search engine. Run search and website should open. Navigate through website via search bar and tabs. 
	Design Challenges/Solutions: 
		Getting the pictures to upload to site, dynamic search bar, having the page open to the correct animal + info when requesting further information on an animal
